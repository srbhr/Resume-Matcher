# Agent MD Refactor

Refactor bloated agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, COPILOT.md, etc.) to follow **progressive disclosure principles** - keeping essentials at root and organizing the rest into linked, categorized files.

---

## Triggers

Use this skill when:

- "refactor my AGENTS.md" / "refactor my CLAUDE.md"
- "split my agent instructions"
- "organize my CLAUDE.md file"
- "my AGENTS.md is too long"
- "progressive disclosure for my instructions"
- "clean up my agent config"

---

## Quick Reference

| Phase         | Action                       | Output                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1. Analyze    | Find contradictions          | List of conflicts to resolve    |
| 2. Extract    | Identify essentials          | Core instructions for root file |
| 3. Categorize | Group remaining instructions | Logical categories              |
| 4. Structure  | Create file hierarchy        | Root + linked files             |
| 5. Prune      | Flag for deletion            | Redundant/vague instructions    |

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Find Contradictions

Identify any instructions that conflict with each other.

**Look for:**

- Contradictory style guidelines (e.g., "use semicolons" vs "no semicolons")
- Conflicting workflow instructions
- Incompatible tool preferences
- Mutually exclusive patterns

**For each contradiction found:**

```markdown
## Contradiction Found

**Instruction A:** [quote]
**Instruction B:** [quote]

**Question:** Which should take precedence, or should both be conditional?
```

Ask the user to resolve before proceeding.

---

### Phase 2: Identify the Essentials

Extract ONLY what belongs in the root agent file. The root should be minimal - information that applies to **every single task**.

**Essential content (keep in root):**

| Category              | Example                                         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Project description   | One sentence: "A React dashboard for analytics" |
| Package manager       | Only if not npm (e.g., "Uses pnpm")             |
| Non-standard commands | Custom build/test/typecheck commands            |
| Critical overrides    | Things that MUST override defaults              |
| Universal rules       | Applies to 100% of tasks                        |

**NOT essential (move to linked files):**

- Language-specific conventions
- Testing guidelines
- Code style details
- Framework patterns
- Documentation standards
- Git workflow details

---

### Phase 3: Group the Rest

Organize remaining instructions into logical categories.

**Common categories:**

| Category          | Contents                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `typescript.md`   | TS conventions, type patterns, strict mode rules |
| `testing.md`      | Test frameworks, coverage, mocking patterns      |
| `code-style.md`   | Formatting, naming, comments, structure          |
| `git-workflow.md` | Commits, branches, PRs, reviews                  |
| `architecture.md` | Patterns, folder structure, dependencies         |
| `api-design.md`   | REST/GraphQL conventions, error handling         |
| `security.md`     | Auth patterns, input validation, secrets         |
| `performance.md`  | Optimization rules, caching, lazy loading        |

**Grouping rules:**

1. Each file should be self-contained for its topic
2. Aim for 3-8 files (not too granular, not too broad)
3. Name files clearly: `{topic}.md`
4. Include only actionable instructions

---

### Phase 4: Create the File Structure

**Output structure:**

```
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md (or AGENTS.md)     # Minimal root with links
└── .claude/                      # Or docs/agent-instructions/
    ├── typescript.md
    ├── testing.md
    ├── code-style.md
    ├── git-workflow.md
    └── architecture.md
```

**Root file template:**

```markdown
# Project Name

One-sentence description of the project.

## Quick Reference

- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Build:** `pnpm build`
- **Test:** `pnpm test`
- **Typecheck:** `pnpm typecheck`

## Detailed Instructions

For specific guidelines, see:

- [TypeScript Conventions](.claude/typescript.md)
- [Testing Guidelines](.claude/testing.md)
- [Code Style](.claude/code-style.md)
- [Git Workflow](.claude/git-workflow.md)
- [Architecture Patterns](.claude/architecture.md)
```

**Each linked file template:**

```markdown
# {Topic} Guidelines

## Overview

Brief context for when these guidelines apply.

## Rules

### Rule Category 1

- Specific, actionable instruction
- Another specific instruction

### Rule Category 2

- Specific, actionable instruction

## Examples

### Good

\`\`\`typescript
// Example of correct pattern
\`\`\`

### Avoid

\`\`\`typescript
// Example of what not to do
\`\`\`
```

---

### Phase 5: Flag for Deletion

Identify instructions that should be removed entirely.

**Delete if:**

| Criterion        | Example                             | Why Delete          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Redundant        | "Use TypeScript" (in a .ts project) | Agent already knows |
| Too vague        | "Write clean code"                  | Not actionable      |
| Overly obvious   | "Don't introduce bugs"              | Wastes context      |
| Default behavior | "Use descriptive variable names"    | Standard practice   |
| Outdated         | References deprecated APIs          | No longer applies   |

**Output format:**

```markdown
## Flagged for Deletion

| Instruction                      | Reason                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| "Write clean, maintainable code" | Too vague to be actionable        |
| "Use TypeScript"                 | Redundant - project is already TS |
| "Don't commit secrets"           | Agent already knows this          |
| "Follow best practices"          | Meaningless without specifics     |
```

## Execution Checklist

```
[ ] Phase 1: All contradictions identified and resolved
[ ] Phase 2: Root file contains ONLY essentials
[ ] Phase 3: All remaining instructions categorized
[ ] Phase 4: File structure created with proper links
[ ] Phase 5: Redundant/vague instructions removed
[ ] Verify: Each linked file is self-contained
[ ] Verify: Root file is under 50 lines
[ ] Verify: All links work correctly
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid                      | Why                       | Instead                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Keeping everything in root | Bloated, hard to maintain | Split into linked files    |
| Too many categories        | Fragmentation             | Consolidate related topics |
| Vague instructions         | Wastes tokens, no value   | Be specific or delete      |
| Duplicating defaults       | Agent already knows       | Only override when needed  |
| Deep nesting               | Hard to navigate          | Flat structure with links  |

---

## Examples

### Before (Bloated Root)

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

This is a React project.

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces
- Use semicolons
- Prefer const over let
- Use arrow functions
  ... (200 more lines)

## Testing

- Use Jest
- Coverage > 80%
  ... (100 more lines)

## TypeScript

- Enable strict mode
  ... (150 more lines)
```

### After (Progressive Disclosure)

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

React dashboard for real-time analytics visualization.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm test` - Run tests with coverage
- `pnpm build` - Production build

## Guidelines

- [Code Style](.claude/code-style.md)
- [Testing](.claude/testing.md)
- [TypeScript](.claude/typescript.md)
```

---

## Verification

After refactoring, verify:

1. **Root file is minimal** - Under 50 lines, only universal info
2. **Links work** - All referenced files exist
3. **No contradictions** - Instructions are consistent
4. **Actionable content** - Every instruction is specific
5. **Complete coverage** - No instructions were lost (unless flagged for deletion)
6. **Self-contained files** - Each linked file stands alone
