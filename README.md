## How does it work?

</div>

The Resume Matcher takes your resume and job descriptions as input, parses them using Python, and mimics the functionalities of an ATS, providing you with insights and suggestions to make your resume ATS-friendly.

The process is as follows:

1. **Parsing**: The system uses Python to parse both your resume and the provided job description, just like an ATS would. Parsing is critical as it transforms your documents into a format the system can readily analyze.

2. **Keyword Extraction**: The tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to extract the most relevant keywords from the job description. These keywords represent the skills, qualifications, and experiences the employer seeks.

3. **Key Terms Extraction**: Beyond keyword extraction, the tool uses textacy to identify the main key terms or themes in the job description. This step helps in understanding the broader context of what the resume is about.

4. **Vector Similarity Using Qdrant**: The tool uses [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant), a highly efficient vector similarity search tool, to measure how closely your resume matches the job description. This process is done by representing your resume and job description as vectors in a high-dimensional space and calculating their cosine similarity. The more similar they are, the higher the likelihood that your resume will pass the ATS screening.

On top of that, there are various data visualizations that I've added to help you get started.

## How to install

</div>

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the application.

1. Fork the repository [here](https://github.com/srbhr/Resume-Matcher/fork).

2. Clone the forked repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/Resume-Matcher.git
   cd Resume-Matcher
   ```

3. Create a Python Virtual Environment:

   - Using [virtualenv](https://learnpython.com/blog/how-to-use-virtualenv-python/):

     _Note_: Check how to install virtualenv on your system here [link](https://learnpython.com/blog/how-to-use-virtualenv-python/).

     ```bash
     virtualenv env
     ```

   **OR**

   - Create a Python Virtual Environment:

     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     ```

4. Activate the Virtual Environment.

   - On Windows.

     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux.

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

     **OPTIONAL (For pyenv users)**

   Run the application with pyenv (Refer this [article](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#installing-pyenv))

   - Build dependencies (on ubuntu)

     ```
     sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python openssl
     ```

     ```

     sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev liblzma-dev libncurses-dev

     sudo apt-get install python-tk python3-tk tk-dev

     sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev liblzma-dev

     ```

   - pyenv installer
     ```
        curl https://pyenv.run | bash
     ```
   - Install desired python version
     ```
       pyenv install -v 3.11.0
     ```
   - pyenv with virtual enviroment
     ```
        pyenv virtualenv 3.11.0 venv
     ```
   - Activate virtualenv with pyenv
     ```
        pyenv activate venv
     ```

5. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Prepare Data:

   - Resumes: Place your resumes in PDF format in the `Data/Resumes` folder. Remove any existing contents in this folder.
   - Job Descriptions: Place your job descriptions in PDF format in the `Data/JobDescription` folder. Remove any existing contents in this folder.

7. Parse Resumes to JSON:

   ```python
   python run_first.py
   ```

8. Run the Application:

   ```python
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

**Note**: For local versions, you do not need to run "streamlit_second.py" as it is specifically for deploying to Streamlit servers.

**Additional Note**: The Vector Similarity part is precomputed to optimize performance due to the resource-intensive nature of sentence encoders that require significant GPU and RAM resources. If you are interested in leveraging this feature in a Google Colab environment for free, refer to the upcoming blog (link to be provided) for further guidance.

### Docker

1. Build the image and start application

   ```bash
       docker-compose up
   ```

2. Open `localhost:80` on your browser

### Cohere and Qdrant

1.  Visit [Cohere website registration](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/register) and create an account.
2.  Go to API keys and copy your cohere api key.
3.  Visit [Qdrant website](https://cloud.qdrant.io/) and create an account.
4.  Get your api key and cluster url.
5.  Now create a yaml file named config.yml in Scripts/Similarity/ folder.
6.  The format for the conifg file should be as below:
    ```yaml
    cohere:
      api_key: cohere_key
    qdrant:
      api_key: qdrant_api_key
      url: qdrant_cluster_url
    ```
7.  Please replace your values without any quotes.

_Note: Please make sure that Qdrant_client's version is higher than v1.1_
