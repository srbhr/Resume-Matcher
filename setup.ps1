This Windows-only PowerShell script will:
  - Verify required tools: node, npm, python3, pip3, uv (CORE DEPENDENCIES)
  - Install Ollama via winget
  - Pull gemma3:4b model
  - Install root dependencies via npm
  - Bootstrap both root and backend .env files
  - Bootstrap backend venv and install Python deps via uv
  - Install frontend dependencies via npm

CORE DEPENDENCIES (script will fail if missing):
  - Node.js v18+
  - npm
  - Python 3
  - pip
  - uv (will attempt auto-install)

Windows Requirements:
  - PowerShell 5.1 or later
  - winget (recommended for Ollama installation)

For Linux/macOS systems:
  - Use ./setup.sh instead of this script
