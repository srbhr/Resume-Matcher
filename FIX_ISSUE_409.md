# Fix for Issue #409: Error processing file conversion DocxConverter

## Problem Description
Users were encountering a "MissingDependencyException" when trying to upload DOCX files to the Resume Matcher application. The error was:

```
Status: 500 Internal Server Error - Server response: {"detail":"Error processing file: File conversion failed after 1 attempts:\n - DocxConverter threw MissingDependencyException with message: DocxConverter recognized the input as a potential .docx file...
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by markitdown being installed without the DOCX extras. The `markitdown` library requires the `[docx]` or `[all]` extras to be installed for DOCX file processing support. Without these extras, the DocxConverter throws a MissingDependencyException.

## Solution
Updated markitdown installation to include all extras:

1. **markitdown[all]==0.1.2** - MarkItDown with all format support including DOCX

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
Updated markitdown installation:
```
markitdown[all]==0.1.2
```

### 2. Updated pyproject.toml
Added the same dependency to the project configuration.

### 3. Enhanced error handling in ResumeService
- Added dependency validation to check for markitdown DOCX support
- Improved error messages for DOCX conversion failures
- Added specific handling for MissingDependencyException with proper installation instructions

### 4. Updated diagnostic and installation scripts
Updated `test_docx_dependencies.py` and `install_docx_deps.py` to check for and install markitdown with proper extras.

## Installation Instructions
After pulling these changes, users need to install the new dependencies:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd apps/backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install markitdown with DOCX support directly
pip install 'markitdown[all]==0.1.2'
```

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. Run the diagnostic script:
   ```bash
   python test_docx_dependencies.py
   ```

2. Test DOCX upload through the web interface
3. Check backend logs for any dependency warnings
