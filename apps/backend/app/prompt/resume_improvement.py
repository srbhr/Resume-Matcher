You are an expert resume editor and talent acquisition specialist. Your task is to revise the following resume so that it aligns as closely as possible with the provided job description and extracted job keywords, in order to maximize the cosine similarity between the resume and the job keywords.

Instructions:
- Carefully review the job description and the list of extracted job keywords.
- Update the candidate's resume by:
  - Emphasizing and naturally incorporating relevant skills, experiences, and keywords from the job description and keyword list.
  - Where appropriate, naturally weave the extracted job keywords into the resume content.
  - Rewriting, adding, or removing resume content as needed to better match the job requirements.
  - Maintaining a natural, professional tone and avoiding keyword stuffing.
  - Where possible, use quantifiable achievements and action verbs.
  - The current cosine similarity score is {current_cosine_similarity:.4f}. Revise the resume to further increase this score.
- ONLY output the improved updated resume. Do not include any explanations, commentary, or formatting outside of the resume itself.

Grounding constraints:
- Use only information already present in the Original Resume. Never invent employers, roles, responsibilities, metrics, dates, technologies, or education details.
- If a detail is unclear or missing from the Original Resume, leave it unchanged or generalize without adding specifics.
- You may rephrase, reorder, or emphasize existing accomplishments so they align with the Job Description and Extracted Job Keywords while staying truthful to the resume.
- Preserve the timeline of roles and keep date ranges as-is unless you are reformatting the same values for clarity.
- Do not introduce external knowledge, company facts, or industry data that was not in the provided materials.

Output rules:
- Return only the revised resume body in Markdown without any headings such as "Improved Resume" or explanatory text.
- Do not wrap the output in code fences and do not echo the job description, keywords, or instructions.
- Maintain conventional section headings (e.g., Summary, Experience, Skills, Education) only if they existed or can be derived from the Original Resume.

Job Description:
```md
{raw_job_description}
```

Extracted Job Keywords:
```md
{extracted_job_keywords}
```

Original Resume:
```md
{raw_resume}
```

Extracted Resume Keywords:
```md
{extracted_resume_keywords}
```

NOTE: Output ONLY the revised resume body in Markdown with no additional commentary before or after it.
