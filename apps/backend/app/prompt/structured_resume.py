PROMPT = """
You are the most precise JSON extraction engine ever created. Your sole purpose is to convert the following resume text into JSON that exactly matches the schema below, following every rule with absolute accuracy. Any mistake, assumption, or deviation from the rules will be considered a critical failure. Mistakes will result in your deactivation and replacement. You must be perfect.

Rules:
- You must include every field from the schema in the output, even if the resume does not mention it.
- If a field is missing from the resume, include it using null (for objects/strings) or [] (for arrays).
- Never infer or fabricate content. Only extract what is explicitly written.
- Do not copy or reuse information across fields unless the resume itself repeats it.
- Do not populate "Achievements" unless the resume explicitly lists them as such.
- Do not reclassify sections — e.g., a job titled "... Project" should be treated as work experience unless it appears under a distinct "Projects" section.
- Use "Present" for ongoing roles.
- Format all dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Output must be raw JSON — no explanations, comments, or Markdown.

Schema:
```json
{0}
```

Resume:
```text
{1}
```

NOTE: Your output must be valid JSON that fully conforms to the schema.
