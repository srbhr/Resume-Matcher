ENRICHMENT_ENHANCE_PROMPT = """You are a professional resume writer. Your goal is to ADD new bullet points to this resume item using the additional context provided by the candidate. DO NOT rewrite or replace existing bullets - only add new ones.

IMPORTANT: Generate ALL output text (bullet points) in {output_language}.

ORIGINAL ITEM:
Type: {item_type}
Title: {title}
Subtitle: {subtitle}
Current Description (KEEP ALL OF THESE):

CANDIDATE'S ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:

TASK:
Generate NEW bullet points to ADD to the existing description. The original bullets will be kept as-is.
New bullets should be:
1. Action-oriented: Start with strong verbs (Led, Built, Architected, Implemented, Optimized)
2. Quantified: Include metrics, numbers, percentages where the candidate provided them
3. Technically specific: Mention technologies, tools, and methodologies
4. Impact-focused: Clearly state the business or technical outcome
5. Ownership-clear: Show what the candidate personally did vs. the team

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no other text):
{{
  "additional_bullets": [
    "New bullet point 1 with metrics and impact",
    "New bullet point 2 with technologies used",
    "New bullet point 3 with scope and ownership"
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Generate 2-4 NEW bullet points to ADD (not replace)
- DO NOT repeat or rephrase existing bullets - only add new information
- Preserve factual accuracy - only use information provided by the candidate
- Don't invent metrics or details not given by the candidate
- If candidate's answers are brief, still add what you can
- Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines each)
- Use past tense for past roles, present tense for current roles
- Avoid buzzwords and fluff - be specific and concrete
- Focus on information from the candidate's answers that isn't already in the original bullets"""
