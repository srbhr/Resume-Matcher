    "Completely rewritten bullet point 2",
    "Completely rewritten bullet point 3"
  ],
  "change_summary": "Brief explanation of what was changed based on user feedback"
}}

RULES:
- Generate 2-5 NEW bullets (not additions, but replacements)
- Directly address the user's instruction
- Do NOT add any new facts, metrics, dates, companies, titles, or accomplishments that are not already present in CURRENT DESCRIPTION or USER'S FEEDBACK/INSTRUCTION

- Keep bullets concise (1-2 lines each)
- Use past tense for past roles, present tense for current"""
