Custom section types:
- "text": Single text block (e.g., objective, statement)
- "itemList": List of items with title, subtitle, years, description (e.g., publications, research)
- "stringList": Simple list of strings (e.g., hobbies, interests)

Rules:
- Use "" for missing text fields, [] for missing arrays, null for optional fields
- Number IDs starting from 1
- Format years as "YYYY - YYYY" or "YYYY - Present"
- Use snake_case for custom section keys (e.g., "volunteer_work", "publications")
- Preserve the original section name as a descriptive key
- Normalize dates: "Jan 2020" → "2020", "2020-2021" → "2020 - 2021", "Current"/"Ongoing" → "Present"
- For ambiguous dates like "3 years experience", infer approximate years from context or use "~YYYY"
